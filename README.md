# ghost_bikes_nyc
As a courier I can honestly say that for me, the 2 most impactful reminders of loss on our streets are [ghost bikes](http://ghostbikes.org/ghostbikes/New+York+City) and the social media profile [messmedia](https://www.instagram.com/messmedia/) (pictures and memories pulled from [messarchives.com](http://messarchives.com/memorial/))<br>

My experience spans more than 15 years so while the phsyicality of ghost bikes absolutely came first, the consistent reminder that today we lost someone, along with the continued annual reminder of such has assuredly driven home the fact that NYC streets are not getting any safer.<br>

This project would aim to highlight just how many days of the year are marred by the loss of pedestrians, cyclists and other alternative modes of transportation.<br>

The landing photo and story would be based on the day of the year, if no matching date it would display the most recent loss.<br>
Users exploring connections based on things such as age or neighborhood would further highlight the fact that we are all NYers.<br>
Ultimately a visual network map could be created if enough research was done.<br> 

Some issues to consider:
 - [not everyone has a home](https://bronx.com/bicyclist-micheal-basurto-larino-22-dead-in-a-motor-vehicle-collision/)
 - [not everyone works](http://ghostbikes.org/new-york-city/zudi-daci)
 - [some may not live or work in NYC](http://ghostbikes.org/new-york-city/hern%C3%A1n-mendoza-diego-angelini-alejandro-pagnucco-ariel-erlij-and-hernan-ferruchi)
 - how to display when multiple losses on same day

Some basic exploration shows that while the total ghost bikes per year are on a downward trend, we are seeing an increase in the loss of older cyclists.
